# LDA-Tutorial
📊 Dimensionality Reduction & Model Comparison (Iris Dataset)
This project explores how dimensionality reduction techniques affect the performance of machine learning models using the Iris dataset.

🚀 Workflow Overview
Load and preprocess the data

Standardize features

Train-test split

Model evaluation across three scenarios

Without dimensionality reduction

With PCA (unsupervised)

With LDA (supervised)

*Models used*

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**Evaluation Metrics**

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

🧠 Key Insights
PCA may lower performance slightly since it doesn’t consider class labels.

LDA usually improves classification performance by maximizing class separation.

Logistic Regression and SVM benefit most from LDA.

📁 How to Run
Copy the code cells into Google Colab or run the notebook sequentially.
